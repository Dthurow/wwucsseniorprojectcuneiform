These files are for presenting the end result of the Genetic algorithm
all pretty like. status_stripper.py is a python script that takes the
filepath specified (e.g. "python status_stripper.py dir/status.txt") and
strips out the words in status.txt. It also gives it a header. It 
outputs a file called stripped.txt. this file is now ready for
graph_status.r. That is an R code file that pulls from stripped.txt
and graphs them all against eachother in a nice and pretty way.
